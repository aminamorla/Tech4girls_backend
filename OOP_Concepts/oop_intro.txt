Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most effective approaches to writing software. OOP organizes code into structures
that combine both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that manipulate the data. 

THE FOUR MAIN PRINCIPLES OF OOP.
1. ENCAPSULATION: This principle helps to hide the complexity of the inner workings of an object
from the programs and the programmers that make use of it. it's often refered to as information hiding because the data 
contained within an object and the functions that manipulate the data are bound together and therefore, 
safe from outside interference.

2.ABSTRACTION: abstraction means to simplify reality. It is the implementation of details a d exposing 
only the necessary parts of an object, allowing users to interact with a simplified version.

3. INHERITANCE: Allowing one class to derive the attributes and methods of another class. It result in a hierarchy of 
classes and promote code reusability.

4. POLYMORPHISM: A class can implement an inherited method in its own way. Enabling objects of different classes to be
treated as objects of a common superclass, using methods with the same name but different implementation.

BENEFITS OF OOP TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
1. Modularity: OOP allows for the creation of modular code, making it easier to maintain, update, and debug.
Each object in OOP represents a specific entity or functionality, making it easier to manage and reuse code.
Example: in a banking application, you can create separate objects for customers, accounts, and transactions.
This modularity makes it easier to add new features or update existingones without affecting the rest ot the code.
2. OOP allows for data hiding through encapsulation, which means that the internal implementation details of an object 
are hidden from the outside world. This protects the integrity of the data and prevents direct access to sensitive information.
Example: in a social media application, the user object may have private properties such as password or 
email address that are only accessible through predefined methods like setPassword() or getEmail().
this encapsulation ensures that the data is securely managed.
